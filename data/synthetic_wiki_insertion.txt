"Dynamically typed functional programming languages, such as Lisp, would soon emerge as a result."

"Immutability in functional programming ensures data structues are not modified after creation, allowing for referential transparency."

"This structural sharing allows pure functional data structures to avoid exponential memory growth by reusing unchanged portions of the data."
